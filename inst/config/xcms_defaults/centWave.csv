,Value,Description
TITLE,centWave Parameters,Set parameters for peak detection using the xcms centWave method
ppm,4,"maximal tolerated m/z deviation in consecutive scans, in ppm (parts per million)"
peakwidth,3 20,"Chromatographic peak width, given as range min max in seconds (type two values separated by space)"
snthresh,3,"Signal/Noise (sn) ratio cutoff, with sn defined as (maxo - baseline)/sd, where maxo is the maximum peak intensity, baseline the estimated baseline value and sd the standard deviation of local chromatographic noise."
prefilter,3 100,"prefilter=c(k,I). Prefilter step for the first phase. Mass traces are only retained if they contain at least k peaks with intensity >= I (type two values separated by space)."
fitgauss,FALSE,"TRUE orFALSE, if TRUE a Gaussian is fitted to each peak"
integrate,1,"Integration method. If =1 peak limits are found through descent on the mexican hat filtered data, if =2 the descent is done on the real data. Method 2 is very accurate but prone to noise, while method 1 is more robust to noise but less exact."
firstBaselineCheck,TRUE,"TRUE orFALSE, if TRUE continuous data within ROI is checked to be above 1st baseline"
noise,0,"useful for data that was centroided without any intensity threshold, centroids with intensity < noise are omitted from ROI detection"
mzCenterFun,wMean,"Function to calculate the m/z center of the feature: ""wMean"" intensity weighted mean of the feature m/z values, ""mean"" mean of the feature m/z values, apex use m/z value at peak apex, ""wMeanApex3"" intensity weighted mean of the m/z value at peak apex and the m/z value left and right of it, ""meanApex3"" mean of the m/z value at peak apex and the m/z value left and right of it."
mzdiff,-0.005,representing the minimum difference in m/z dimension for peaks with overlapping retention times; can be negative to allow overlap.
workers,1,"number of worker processes (should not exceed number of available cores, overwritten by server settings if run on server)"
