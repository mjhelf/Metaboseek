"","Value","Description"
"TITLE","CAMERA analysis parameters","Set parameters for peak annotation with the CAMERA package"
"polarity","positive","positive or negative, important for adduct annotation!"
"ppm","5","ppm error for isotope and adduct searches"
"mzabs","0.005","allowed variance for isotope and adduct searches"
"FWHM-Grouping","_______","Group peaks of a xsAnnotate object according to there retention time into pseudospectra-groups. Uses the peak full widths at half maximum (FWHMs) as grouping borders. Returns xsAnnotate object with pseudospectra informations."
"sigma","3","the multiplier of the standard deviation. peakwidth at FWHM is about 2.335*sigma, sigma factor should correspond to what max rt difference can be for features to be grouped."
